# Print Machine

Type in, Risograph print out. A single-screen, installable, iOS-first PWA that
renders text as an authentic multi-colour Riso print — real ink colours, angled
halftone screens, misregistration, ink mottle and paper tooth — and saves the
result straight to the camera roll via the share sheet.

**Deployed:** https://chattedomestique.github.io/PrintMachine/

## What "authentic" means here

A halftone filter is not a Riso. The things that actually make a print read as
printed, all of which this engine models:

| Effect             | Why it matters                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Angled screens     | Each ink gets its own screen angle. The interference between them is the rosette your eye reads as "printed". |
| Misregistration    | A real Riso pulls each colour on a separate pass and the paper never lands twice in the same place. This is the single biggest tell. |
| Subtractive overprint | Riso ink is transparent. Pink over blue is purple, not pink. Alpha compositing gets this wrong. |
| Ink mottle         | Drum ink lays down unevenly — low-frequency blotch plus speckle dropout.                          |
| Paper tooth        | The stock is not white and not smooth.                                                            |
| Density ceiling    | Riso ink never reaches full black. Capping density is what keeps it from looking like inkjet.      |

## Running it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

```sh
npm run lint       # ESLint, must exit 0
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # Vitest, engine only
npm run build      # production build
PAGES=1 npm run build   # production build for the GitHub Pages sub-path
```

Icons are generated, not hand-drawn — `node scripts/gen-icons.mjs` redraws the
whole set from the same overprint math the app uses.

## Architecture

```
src/
  engine/    pure, framework-free canvas + typed-array maths. No React, no DOM
             events, no state. This is the product, and the only thing tested.
  state/     one settings reducer + Context over a coalescing undo/redo hook.
  ui/        token-driven, app-agnostic primitives.
  features/  app-aware composition — the only layer that knows what the app is.
  styles/    tokens.css (the design system) + index.css.
```

`engine/` must never import from `state/`, `ui/`, or `features/`, and must never
touch React or the DOM beyond a canvas context handed to it. That constraint is
what lets the export path re-render a fresh, overlay-free frame with the exact
same code the preview uses.

## Deliberate deviations from the playbook

- **TypeScript, not the JS that Borders used.** The playbook makes TS strict the
  default (§2.1) and `tsc --noEmit` is in the CI gate.
- **p5.riso is ported, not depended on.** The library
  ([Sam Lavigne & Tega Brain](https://github.com/antiboredom/p5.riso)) is the
  right reference, but it isn't on npm, it requires all of p5.js, and its
  `halftoneImage()` allocates two buffers at 2× width *and* 2× height — at export
  size that is the iOS eviction path §4.2 exists to prevent. The ink table is
  lifted verbatim with credit and the screening/dithering is reimplemented as
  pure typed-array code, per §1.3 ("use the best algorithm, the best port — note
  the provenance and move on") and §14 ("don't add heavy dependencies").
- **Neutral gray chrome, not the playbook's warm `#F1EBE2`.** This app's job is
  showing what ink looks like on paper; tinted chrome shifts how the inks read.
  The one accent is Riso Fluorescent Pink.
- **`verify` also runs on pull requests**, not just pushes to `main`. §11.1 wants
  the CI gate hung on the PR; the §16.7 template only triggers on push.

## Status

Text is the first input. Photo intake runs through the same
separate → screen → misregister → overprint pipeline and lands next.
